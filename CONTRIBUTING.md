# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull requests adhere to the following guidelines:

* Search open and closed PR's to avoid duplicate suggestions.
* Only submit jQuery tips that you think would be useful to others. This implies each tip has enough succinct content to describe why it's useful.
* Add your tip at the bottom of the [README](https://github.com/AllThingsSmitty/jquery-tips-everyone-should-know/blob/master/README.md) document. Add a link to your tip at the bottom of the table of contents.
* Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com).
* Code formatting should follow standard [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) default settings, use single quotes, and indent with two spaces.
* PR's should include a snippet .js file added to the `js` folder.
* Snippet folders should be named identical to the tip being added in the [README](https://github.com/AllThingsSmitty/jquery-tips-everyone-should-know/blob/master/README.md) document using the following convention: `make-two-divs-the-same-height`.
* Snippets should begin with a comment that matches the name of the tip, e.g., `// Make two divs the same height`.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* The PR should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!
